# Digital Parachute


* Archival code from the 2017 Interactive Experience : _Nova_ : [Digital Parachute](https://www.ameliascott.ca/nova-digital-parachute)
* 10x Indidividual Arduino devices controlling LED strips in the parachute
* 1x Master "Handle" that is operable via bluetooth remote
* Synchronization between handles using RS422 and [ICSC](https://github.com/MajenkoLibraries/ICSC) protocol for timing
* Makes heavy use of FastLED in this version of the code
* This version does not implement any Bluetooth control
